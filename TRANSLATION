Harrys My Free Farm Bash Bot
----------------------------

TRANSLATION
-----------

If you want to help translate the bot's GUI to another language, here's
a little guidance.

- Files should be created as UTF-8 using UNIX-style line breaks.

- In the GUI's lang folder, copy lang.en.php to lang.xx.php, where xx is the
  two letter code of the language, you want to translate to. Ideally, this
  code is the same as the top level domain of your MFF game server.

- Translate all contained strings in the newly created lang.xx.php

- In the GUI's data folder, copy the en folder to a new folder xx, using above
  mentioned requirements.

- Change all files to reflect your language. The *.txt files' contents can be
  extracted from your game servers source code, after you log in to MFF.
  Please don't forget translating and appending "998":"Bonus Plant" to
  productlist.txt, which is not an official My Free Farm item.

- TEST your new language files before transmitting them to me, for i won't be
  testing them!

- ZIP (or gzip) the new files and send'em to me. Don't forget to tell me what
  name you'd like to be credited with and if you wish for me to publish your
  eMail address or not.
