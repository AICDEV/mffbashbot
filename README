Harrys My Free Farm Bash Bot (MFF Bash Bot)
-------------------------------------------

README

Deutschsprachige: Schaut bitte in die README_DE Datei.

These files contain a Bash bot for the "My Free Farm" game.
This software needs (among other things) PHP >=v5.4 and jq >=v1.5

Be advised, that the use of bots is against the game providers' terms and
conditions. Your game account may be suspended by using this bot.
Use the bot scripts at your OWN RISK. You have been warned.

I want to encourage you, to support the game designers every now and then by
purchasing coins.

Coders may notice, that i'm not a coder by trade. But as long as my code works
(for me), it doesn't need to be pretty :)

This bot would not have seen the light of day without the superb work of
Bastian Kanaan. His 'Adviser' and 'Automaton' have been working for many gamers
reliably. Inspired by Bastian's Automaton, i started developing this bot. His
Adviser is still a loyal comapanion to me.

Find info on how to install this bot in the (you've guessed it) INSTALL file.

Basic operation instructions for the bot can be found in the MANUAL file.

If you feel obliged to make a donation for my work, i'll happily transmit my
PayPal details.
