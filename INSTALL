Harrys My Free Farm Bash Bot
----------------------------

Installation
------------

A) Debian-based distributions
B) Windows (using Cygwin)
C) Bash on Windows 10

A)
You need at least basic Linux knowledge at this point.
If you don't know about basic Linux stuff, you can either try and learn it or
refrain from installing the bot. I might write some sort of setup script in the
future. You surely understand i can't explain here how to log on to Linux or
how to edit files.

Packets like sudo, sed, wget, (p)grep etc. should be already on your box.
And as the product name suggests, you'll also need the bash ;)

Start a terminal and enter (without the double quotes)
"wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HackerHarry/mffbashbot/master/install.sh"
Change it to "executable":
"chmod +x install.sh"
This script does most of the work for you. Just enter:
"./install.sh" and hit ENTER.

A wizard will guide you through the initial bot setup.

If you need to make manual changes to the config.ini, make sure to leave the
white spaces in front and behind the equal sign. Make also sure you don't use
the exclamation mark (!) for your first character of your password. Please also
don't use the single quote (') _within_ your password.

Congrats: The bot is now installed.
Find info on how to start the bot in the MANUAL file.

You can access the bots GUI where you've installed your web server.
Just use http://IP-or-Hostname/mffbashbot/ or, if it runs locally,
http://localhost/mffbashbot/

If you want to operate more than one farm, you can use an existing farm as a
template. The new farm's name in the example is 'inge05' :

harry@testbox:~$ cd ~/mffbashbot
harry@testbox:~/mffbashbot$ cp -a dummy/ inge05
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B)
Tested on Windows 7 SP1 x64

Donwload and start the setup program
https://github.com/HackerHarry/mffbashbot/raw/master/mffbashbot-setup.exe

Cygwin will be downloaded and installed during setup.
After that, the bot will be installed within Cygwin then a wizard will guide you
through the initial bot setup.

You can start or control the bot using the appropriate icons on your desktop
or the start menu.
Configure the bot using your web browser (I only support Mozilla Firefox).
The address is http://localhost/mffbashbot/

For manual configuration of the password, server-no. and language, see the
notes in the Linux-install section.

The MANUAL file gives you an insight on how to start the bot.

If you want to operate more than one farm, find some info on that in the
MANUAL file.

C)
Tested on Windows 10 x64 Version 1703 Build 15063.0

The Bash installation won't be covered here.
There are several useful guides on the internet that'll help you install the
Bash on Windows, like this one:
www.windowscentral.com/how-install-bash-shell-command-line-windows-10

Once the Bash is installed, start it and follow the instructions from A).

Hint: The lighttpd server will not automatically start, if you have to restart
the Bash shell. You might have to issue a 'sudo service start lighttpd' command in
that case.
